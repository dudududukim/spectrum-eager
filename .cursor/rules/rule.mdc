# Jekyll YAML-First Customization Rules

This Jekyll site prioritizes **maximum user customization** through YAML configuration files. The core philosophy is enabling non-technical users to completely transform the site by editing only YAML files, never touching HTML/CSS/JS.

## Core Architecture Principles

**Never hardcode content in templates** - All text, images, colors, settings, and layout options must be configurable through YAML data files in `_data/` directory.

**Design for non-developers** - Use intuitive field names, provide comprehensive examples, and include detailed comments in YAML files explaining each option.

**Modular component system** - Create reusable includes that accept YAML parameters and can be toggled on/off with `enabled: true/false` flags.

## Data Structure Guidelines

- Store ALL customizable content in `_data/` directory with logical organization
- Use descriptive YAML keys that make sense to non-technical users (e.g., `hero_title` not `ht`)
- Include `enabled: true/false` flags for every optional section
- Provide sensible fallbacks for missing or empty YAML values using `| default:` filters
- Group related settings in nested objects for better organization

## Template Development Rules

When creating/editing layouts and includes:
- Use Liquid loops and conditionals to render YAML data dynamically
- Pass YAML data as parameters to includes: `{% include section.html data=site.data.homepage.hero %}`
- Handle missing data gracefully with default values and conditional rendering
- Make every visual element (colors, fonts, spacing, images) configurable through YAML
- Support both simple and advanced configuration modes for different user skill levels

## Required YAML File Structure

Organize data files by function:
- `_data/site.yml` - Global branding, contact info, SEO settings
- `_data/theme.yml` - Colors, fonts, layout preferences, responsive breakpoints
- `_data/homepage.yml` - Landing page sections, hero, features, testimonials  
- `_data/navigation.yml` - Header/footer menus, social media links
- `_data/content.yml` - Business-specific content (services, portfolio, team, etc.)

## User Experience Requirements

- Include detailed YAML comments explaining each configuration option
- Provide multiple example configurations for different industries (restaurant, portfolio, agency, blog, etc.)
- Test all template configurations work with various content amounts (empty, minimal, extensive)
- Ensure complete mobile responsiveness for all layout combinations
- Create comprehensive non-technical documentation

## Multi-Purpose Flexibility

Design templates to work for diverse use cases through YAML configuration alone:
- Personal portfolios, business websites, blogs, documentation sites
- Industry-specific sites: restaurants, agencies, non-profits, events, e-commerce
- Different layouts: single-page, multi-page, landing pages, galleries

## Quality Assurance

Before implementing any new feature, ask: "Can a non-technical user configure this entirely through YAML editing?" If not, redesign the approach.

Always test edge cases: missing YAML values, empty arrays, disabled sections, mobile devices, and different content lengths.
